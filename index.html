      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm a Fullstack Developer student, currently in batch #599 at Le Wagon London. I'm a code enthusiast and I've been playing around for the past years coding by myself and studing the basics. This year I decided to make this my career and I'm very excited to start my own projects, build my portfolio and find a job that I can learn as well help the company grow! Some random facts about me: I'm currently working with coffee and I love it, my plan is to keep it as one of my hobbies and keep learning about it. I'm also a plant enthusiast, and during the lock down this passion got serious! I added 30+ plants to my collection, call me crazy but they where like my therapy during that time, no regrets!</p><br>
